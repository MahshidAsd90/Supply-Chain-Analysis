# Supply Chain Analysis
### Make vs Buy

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the "Make vs Buy" decision in supply chain management using Power BI. The goal is to evaluate whether manufacturing a product in-house or sourcing it from external suppliers is more cost-effective. The analysis leverages real-world data and Power BI's analytical capabilities to provide insights into cost structures, scenario analysis, and investment requirements.

## Project Steps

1. Understanding the Buy Option

Collected and processed supplier quotes.

Analyzed key factors such as unit cost, volume, and non-recurring expenses.

Calculated the full cost of buying based on extended cost formulas.

2. Scenario Analysis with Volume Changes

Identified uncertainties in supply chain decisions.

Built dynamic scenario analysis models using Power BI.

Implemented volume parameters and iterative functions to evaluate different cost scenarios.

3. Assessing the Make Option

Developed internal cost estimates including raw materials, labor, and energy costs.

Evaluated production capacity and the need for additional investment in equipment.

Differentiated between incremental and sunk costs in decision-making.

4. Final Analysis & Comparison

Compared full costs of "Make" vs "Buy" decisions.

Assessed key factors such as quality, cost efficiency, and scalability.

Visualized results in Power BI for better decision-making.

## Technologies Used

Power BI (Data visualization & analysis)

SQL / PostgreSQL (Data management)

DAX (Data analysis expressions in Power BI)

Excel (Data preprocessing & validation)

## Results & Insights

Identified cost-efficient choices based on different production volumes.

Determined when it is more beneficial to manufacture in-house versus outsourcing.

Provided a scalable framework for decision-making in supply chain management.
